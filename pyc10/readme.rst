PyChapter10 Samples
===================

These samples use a pure-python library (PyChapter10_).

Dependencies
------------

* Python_ 2.7
* PyChapter10_
* docopt_

Building and Running
--------------------

If the dependencies are installed you can run each sample from the commandline using python (eg: python c10_stat.py) and commandline help will show you how to use each one.

To build .exe files you will also need the cx_Freeze_ library. Once installed you should be able to use the setup.py script to build like so: python setup.py build
