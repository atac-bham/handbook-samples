C Samples
=========

This section contains code samples written in C/C++.

Dependencies
------------

* Qt5

Building
--------

The /vs directory has Microsoft Visual C projects for each sample. You should be able to build, debug, and run within Visual Studio (I used Ultimate 2013).

*Note:* You may need to change the "Additional include directories" option
under Project->Properties->C/C++.
